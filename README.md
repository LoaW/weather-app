## What is this page about?

"You have been sent abroad for a 10-month work mission. Your family and friends back home ask you about the weather where you live ALL. THE. TIME.
Enough is enough, you decide to build a small web application for them so that you can free your time to talk about more interesting topics."

You can look at a final preview here at [Weather App](https://loaw.github.io/weather-app/)
